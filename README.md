## Download

You may download the latest Mac release [here](https://github.com/hph/wings/releases).
You may also [build the app](https://github.com/hph/wings#building-for-production)
manually, which should work on Mac, Linux and Windows.

## Usage

Wings is heavily inspired by Vim and currently supports a subset of its
commands, in addition to some new things. At this time there is no proper
documentation or even a list of features, but you can check out the keys
section of the [default config](https://github.com/hph/wings/blob/master/src/main-process/default-config.yaml)
to learn more.

## Development

In order to run Wings in development mode you will need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/download),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and ideally
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Once you have all of those
installed, you may fetch the project and install its dependencies as follows:

    git clone git@github.com:hph/wings.git
    cd wings
    yarn install

In order to build the app and automatically rebuild it when the code is
changed, open a new terminal in the same directory and run:

    yarn build:dev

You should now be able to go back to the previous terminal and start Wings:

    yarn start

You may optionally provide an argument to open a file, such as `package.json`:

    yarn start package.json

## Testing & code quality

The project is set up with a small but growing set of tests and a linter, both
of which you can run:

    yarn lint
    yarn test

You can see the results for the linter and tests for the master branch on
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/hph/wings) and code coverage information on
[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/hph/wings).

## Building for production

The build process is a bit slower in production mode as it minifies the code
and also builds the app into a single package. Run the following command:

    NODE_ENV=production yarn build

The production build has only been tested on a Mac. If you run into any issues,
please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/hph/wings/issues/new).
